##  Usage

### Organize Files

```bash
node input.js organize <directory_path>
```

* If no path is provided, it organizes files in the current working directory.

### Example

```bash
node input.js organize ./Downloads
```

This will create a new folder `organized_files` inside `./Downloads` and categorize files into:

* `media/`
* `documents/`
* `images/`
* `applications/`
* `others/`

---

## Supported File Types

```js
{
  media:       ["mp4", "mkv", "mp3", "wav"],
  documents:   ["pdf", "docx", "txt", "xlsx"],
  images:      ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif"],
  applications:["exe", "dmg", "pkg"]
}
```

Unrecognized extensions go into the `others/` folder.

## Future Improvements

* Add support for custom file type definitions
* Recursive file scanning
* GUI version for non-terminal users
